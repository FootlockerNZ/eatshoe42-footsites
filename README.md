Footsites Bot

Create your tasks and profiles from Main.java. 

Put your delays/webhooks in Settings.java

Dependencies are in pom.xml

I will add an exe soon and add task creation from command line

I don't recommend actually using this on a drop this is just so people can see how footsites work

You must put the adyen.exe in C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\eatshoeFootsites\ it is needed.

You also need to have proxies in C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\eatshoeFootsites\proxies.txt or else you will get an error.

btw address line2 doesnt work
